"k." en comments "A community self-organizes itself through symbolic systems. As citizens, we commit ourselves to promises and contracts. We obey the law. The members of a clan may have a totemic animal. We fight under the same flag. We exchange economic goods by agreeing upon their value. Our obligations and conventions tie us by sharing of symbols. Sociology highlights these essential symbolic functions that constitute society."
