"d." en comments "A message contains a representation of reality. A discourse is true if it is a correct description of a state of things. Traditions concerned with logical and analytical philosophies are primarily interested in the notion of truth and the problems of reference. Likewise, epistemology and cognitive sciences place the construction of true belief, or knowledge, at the foundation of their approach."
