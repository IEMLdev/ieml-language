"O:O:." en comments "In order to understand O x O we have to think about the basic sensorimotor cycle. Let's begin with the inner sanctum of personal existence that does not manifest externally: to exist. Then, from this virtual place, we act. As a result, our actual environment is transformed and a new reality appears or happens. Finally, from the actuality of external happening, we perceive back to our inner existence. Note the two intertwined oppositions : \n\n• wa act (in –> out) / wu perceive (out –> in) \n\n• wo exist (in –> in) / we appear (out –> out)\n\nwo wa wu we can be used to model any quaternary semantic symmetry. They can also be used to « verbify » nominal semes when creating new words."
